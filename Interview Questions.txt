******************      What is a CRM    *****************

Customers are the cornerstone of any business

CRM stands for customer relationship management. As the name suggests, it focuses on managing all relationships with current and potential customers. 
CRM allows businesses to stay connected with customers, build lasting relationships, and streamline all customer-related processes.

CRM can be as simple as keeping records of your customers and the products theyâ€™ve brought. 
Today, as businesses become more customer-centric and gain access to large amounts of readily available data, 
dedicated CRM tools and software can add more value to this process in the following ways.
